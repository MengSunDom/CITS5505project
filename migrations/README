# 📦 Database Migration Guide (Flask-Migrate + Alembic)

This project uses **Flask-Migrate** and **Alembic** to manage database schema changes in a version-controlled way. Below is the step-by-step guide for initializing and updating your database schema.

---

## ✅ Initial Setup (First-Time Only)

Run these commands when setting up the project for the first time:

```bash
# 1. Initialize migration environment
flask db init

# 2. Generate initial migration script from your models
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"

# 3. Apply the migration to create all tables
flask db upgrade


## 🔁 Updating Tables (Every Time Models Change)
Whenever you update your SQLAlchemy models (e.g. add a new column or model), do the following:
# 1. Generate a new migration script
flask db migrate -m "Describe what changed"

# 2. Apply the changes to the database
flask db upgrade
