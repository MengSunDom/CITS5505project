## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3 and pip are installed.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/reilkay/CITS5505project.git
cd CITS5505project

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Copy `config-example.py` to `config.py`, and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
cp config-example.py config.py
# Edit config.py to add your openai API key and flask secret key.
```

You can generate a secure Flask secret key by running the following in Python:

```python
import secrets
print(secrets.token_hex(32))
```

Copy the generated value and set it as your `SECRET_KEY` in `config.py` to ensure session security.

### Running the App

```bash
# Apply database migrations, initializing the database
flask db upgrade

# Run the application
python app.py
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5001`.
